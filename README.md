# Challenge -12
## Employee Tracker

- For the twelfth challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with creating a CMS application that populates and edits the employee database in the command line. It will allow the user to view employees, edit and select through current data. I will be using inquirer, node, mysql2, and console.table.
